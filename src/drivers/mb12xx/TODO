Maybe create new drv_range_finder.h
-> drv_range_finder_multsens.h

Change struct range_finder_report:
array of size MAX_ADDR_COUNT float[] distance, uint8_t[] valid
start_sensor
end_sensor

Interface from interface_test to mb12xx
Handling of groups

Address array is read in and passed to constructor
TODO
Take care of accesses to struct range_finder_multsens_report (eg. test function)
Take care of measure and collect
